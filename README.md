Here's just the nice description for me, so it won't look so empty :)

# Overview
The main goal of the implementation of this project was: to determine the effectiveness and speed of execution of the topological sorting algorithm
based on DFS. 

Therefore, an experiment was conducted for this purpose
which we determined under which parameters this algorithm is more productive. The execution speed of this algorithm is affected by two factors: the size and density of the graph. 

# How to set up
